# Letterboxing
A Minecraft mod that adds customizable letter- and pillarboxing for more immersive gameplay. Select from presets of popular aspect ratios or customize it to your own liking. Experience absolute cinema whether in f1-mode or in normal game modes (survival, creative, adventure). Spectator mode can become truly cinematic too. Additionally, the carved pumpkin overlay can be replaced with cinema bars, as inspired by [this texture pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/cinematic-bars/).

> [!Important]
> This mod requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to access the mod's configuration menu. If you don't want to install Mod Menu, you can alternatively edit this mod's configuration file located in `.minecraft/config/` after the first boot with this mod.

      Which mods are compatible?
    </strong>
</summary>
 <p>
This mod makes heavy use of Fabric API's Mixin system, which modifies existing code in the base game.
If another mod also affects the same lines of code, issues may occur.
Therefore, I added the option to disable the Mixins for auto-adjusting individual GUI elements, namely:
<code>Bossbar</code>, <code>Chat</code>, <code>Debug Menu</code>, <code>Player HUD</code>, <code>Toasts</code>, and <code>Subtitles</code>. It is left to the user to check compatibility with other mods.

      Why was this mod created? Aren't there already other mods that do the same?
    </strong>
</summary>
  <p>
    To my knowledge, there aren't other mods that add the letter- and pillarboxing effect, particularly when it comes to customizability. This motivated the creation of this mod as well as getting into Minecraft modding in general. Maybe the mod will also inspire some players to find new ways of playing the game (e.g., with the phone aspect ratio).
